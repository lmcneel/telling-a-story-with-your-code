### Movement

> I struggled with the name of this. Ultimately, I was modeling the example off changing "walking" to "strolling" or "running" or "jumping" when writing prose. I think the name is accurate, but it feels weird. Its a good place for the discussion of the naming of things.

- main.js
  - entry point of the application
  - definitely a carry-over from C based programming
  - Seems sound reasoning because it is the main file
  - I could call it index.js which gives benefits on an import statement, but does it mean anything or benefit the story
- main-alt.js
  - The same thing as main, kind of...
- movement.js
  - The types of movement that can happen and other related items

When you examine the code, first look at file names. I have described their purpose, but does the purpose match the contents. Can you think of better names for the files?

Start with `main-alt.js`. Do you need to know the contents of movement.js to get read the story? To understand the file and the purpose of the file. Do the function names make sense?  If you read it out loud, does it read reasonably well?

Move to `main.js`. Do you need to know the contents of movement.js to get read the story? To understand the file and the purpose of the file. Do the function names make sense?  If you read it out loud, does it read reasonably well?

What is the story of the code? Which version is better reading?

There is room for improvement, for expansion. There is always room for that. But its a start of a story, the functions describe the actions they do. 

Please feel free to file an issue to suggest improvements on the story.
